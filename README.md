# Mic1 Disassembler


This disassembler is meant to interpret the byte codes given by instructions of the mic1 architecure. The mic1 architecture was defined [here](https://www.tjhsst.edu/~dhyatt/arch/mic1.html) or really close.

## Architecture Features

This architecture only had one bus that you could load at a time, but the intents and purposes of this project was to take the raw byte code, and show what the instructions were meant to be.


## Other software

This software was based on a really old Java simulator that loaded the byte code to a JVM. Good luck finding that.
